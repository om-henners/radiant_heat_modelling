# Radiant Heat Modelling

This library implements the calculations found in:

> Midgley, S. & Tan, Z., 2006. A methodology for determining minimum separation 
> distance between a structure and bushfire hazard. Life In A 
> Fire-Prone Environment: Translating Science Into Practice, pp.6â€“9.

At the same time it provides the following helper utilities (at the moment a 
TODO list as much as anything):

## Features

### TODO

- Calculations for grasslands
- Optimisation for minimum separation distance for a site
- Implement `bumpversion` for version numbers
- ArcGIS toolbox tool for separation distance
- QGIS toolbox tool for separation distance
- Unit tests
- Talk to SV before eleasing this into the wild

### Done

- Calculations for forests and woodlands
