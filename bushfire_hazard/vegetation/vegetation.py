Generic vegetation definition.

Define an abstract vegetation class. Based on the paper:

Midgley, S. & Tan, Z., 2006. A methodology for determining minimum separation
distance between a structure and bushfire hazard. Life In A Fire-Prone
Environment: Translating Science Into Practice, pp.6â€“9.

this defines the standard methods as required to determine the flame length,
rate of spread, radiant heat flux, view factor and transmittance factor.
